# Future Work and Integration Roadmap

## Current Limitations
The system **shall encounter** significant challenges regarding real-time scalability, as the current graph construction methods **will struggle** to process millions of patient records efficiently. Furthermore, the reliance on static word embeddings **will limit** the model's ability to interpret emerging medical slang or rare conditions without frequent retraining, necessitating a transition to dynamic language models.

## Future Integrations
To expand its utility, the platform **will feature** four key integrations:

1. **Smart Wearable Ecosystems**: The application **will synchronize** with devices like Apple Watch and Oura Ring to continuously monitor vital signs (heart rate, sleep quality). This data **shall enable** the system to detect pre-symptomatic anomalies and trigger early health alerts before users even feel unwell.
2. **Emergency Response Dispatch**: For critical predictions such as cardiac arrest or stroke, the improved chatbot **will interface** directly with emergency services (911/112). It **will automatically transmit** the user's location and preliminary diagnosis to dispatchers, significantly reducing response times in life-threatening situations.
3. **Health Insurance Pre-Authorization**: The system **will integrate** with insurance provider APIs to streamline the claims process. It **shall generate** automated preliminary diagnostic reports that **will facilitate** instant pre-authorization for recommended tests or specialist visits, reducing administrative bottlenecks.
4. **Voice-Assistant Accessibility**: To support elderly and visually impaired users, the project **will be deployed** as a skill on smart home platforms like Amazon Alexa and Google Home. This integration **will allow** users to perform comprehensive symptom checks and receive guidance entirely through hands-free voice commands.
